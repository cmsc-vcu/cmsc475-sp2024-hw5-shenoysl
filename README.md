# Satya's Homework 5 - building a navigation scaffold

For this assignment, I had to build a scaffold of my navigation in p5js, coding out the navigation methods that I devised in the last homework

Since it is just a scaffold for this assignment, the panels are not my dynamic Figma frames, rather they are just simple static panels that are placeholders for now

In the reports folder, you will find the QMD and HTML versions of the report, the p5js sketch is embedded there in an iframe and you can interact with it as well

Also in the reports folder is an assets folder which holds PNG files of my Figma frames
